# Scan 3D

## Setup

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Download and install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

``` bash
# Fetch and update LFS files
git lfs fetch
git lfs update

# Install dependencies (only for first time)
npm i

# Serve at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```

## Generate data

### Photos

- Take photos with great natural light
- Don't shake
- Lock focus and brightness to a setting without to much saturation
- If objects are far (few meters) walk 3 to 4 steps between photos
- If objects are close (less than 2 meters) walk a maximum of 2 steps between photos
- Keep the the angle slightly above the horizon
- Try not to have the sun in front of you

### 3DF Zephyr Aerials

#### Import and generate

- Open 3DF Zephyr Aerials
- Drag and drop the photo sequence
- Use those settings

<img src="./resources/images/01-generate-02.png" width="400">
<img src="./resources/images/01-generate-03.png" width="400">
<img src="./resources/images/01-generate-04.png" width="400">
<img src="./resources/images/01-generate-05.png" width="400">
- Run and wait (it can take from few minutes to few hours depending on the quality and quantity of the photos)

#### Export

- Export as OBJ
<br><img src="./resources/images/02-export-obj-01.png" width="320">
- Use those settings
<br><img src="./resources/images/02-export-obj-02.png" width="320">

### Blender

#### Geometry

- Import the model in Blender
- Merge vertices by distance
- Rotate the scene (Z postive = up, Y positive = forward)
- Fix incorrect areas (floor, ceiling, reflections)
- Create a man reference (can be a simple box 180cm high) and scale the model accordingly
- Run `/resources/blender/textureToVertexColor/textureToVertexColors.py` to convert texture to vertex color (you might need to change the image name in the last line of the script)
- Export as PLY
- Use those settings
<br><img src="./resources/images/03-export-ply-01.png" width="220">
- Remove faces from PLY file (we only need the vertices with their color)
<br><img src="./resources/images/03-export-ply-02.png" width="360">

#### Collision primitive

- Create collision JSON using primitives (box, circle, sphere)
- Resize, move and rotate the primitives but do not change the vertices directly and do not apply transformations
- Export using the script `/resources/blender/primitiveJsonExporter/main.py`
- Use those settings
<br><img src="./resources/images/04-export-collision-01.png" width="200">

#### Floor

- Create Ã  geometry roughly following the floor
- Export as PLY
- Use those settings
